# CustomizationChallenge

This project was developed as a challenge for Wit Software by Diogo Barroso.

1. The models and animations used in this project were obtained from Mixamo for free. The remaining assets are from the Unity Engine, having all the code been written by the author of this project.

2. The User is able to see 2 characters in the first Scene, with the respective name above their heads. By tapping in a character, the User is taken to a customization screen in which they can edit their name, by typing it into a text box, the animation displayed (Yelling, Jumping and Looking Around) by using two arrows. They can also edit their height, using a Slider. At any time, the User can Confirm the modifications or discard them by pressing Cancel.

3. This project was tested in Android devices with different resolutions, but not in iOS because of not having access to such devices. Its' performance is not guaranteed in case of being compiled to iOS devices.
